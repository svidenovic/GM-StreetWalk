# GM-StreetWalk

This project uses Google Maps API and the idea was to develop a faster way to use Google Street view. Given two addresses it will visually lead you from point A to B, acting like a video player. There's a bit of math I had to write myself, like interpolation of points on a geodesic route, in order to make smoother transitions.
